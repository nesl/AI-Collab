        <head><![CDATA[<b>Welcome to this Tutorial!</b> This tutorial introduces the skills necessary to take part effectively in the collaborative task related to our research. In this task, you will take control of a robot to detect and remove dangerous objects from the simulated world in collaboration with other robots which may be controlled by humans or computer programs. We will be explaining the mechanics of the robot and the simulated environment through a series of popup windows such as this one, which will be triggered after you perform the requested actions. Please make sure to always scroll to the bottom of these windows and click on the <b>Next</b> button. You can always review previous information by using the <b>Back</b> button.]]></head>

        <title>Tutorial</title>
        
        <list><![CDATA[Each robot in the simulated environment has a first-person view camera. When this popup window closes, you will see a video stream showing such first-person view of the robot you are controlling. This first-person view contains some visual elements that will be explained here but will be reexamined later.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[<b>Strength indicator</b>: shows your current strength, calculated from the summation of individual strengths of neighboring robots. To carry objects, you have to surpass their weight value with your strength.]]></list> 
        <list><![CDATA[<b>Timer</b>: displays the elapsed time since the start of the session. Currently, the time limit is of 20 minutes.]]></list> 
        <list><![CDATA[<b>Location</b>: displays the location of your robot in 2D coordinates. The current room size is 5 meters by 10 meters. The coordinate (0,0) corresponds to the center of the world. For this tutorial, you will see a series of blue points in the ground that are separated horizontally and vertically by 1 meter. This will help you have a better sense of distance between objects and agents. (Note: the goal area in the tutorial is not the center of the world.)]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[<b>Carried objects</b>: displays the IDs of the objects currently being carried. <b>L</b> corresponds to left arm, <b>R</b> corresponds to right arm.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[<b>Action status</b>: displays the status of the action being performed. If you lose balance (you are tipping) it will be shown here.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[<b>Targets in goal</b>: shows the number of truly dangerous objects already carried to the goal area by any team member.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[<b>White dot</b>: you have to align this white dot with an object in order to focus on it and pick it up.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[On top of the first-person view camera you will notice a line of text that will be changing from <b>Active</b> to <b>Not Active</b> and vice versa. When <b>Active</b> is shown, this means the keys you press will be sent to the simulated environment to control the robot. If it says <b>Not Active</b> you will have to hover your mouse pointer over the first-person view to regain control.]]></list>

        <list><![CDATA[After clicking on <b>Next</b>, move your robot to the center of the room, which is highlighted by a fire. You have to enter the fire for the next popup window to appear. For now, we will be using fires to guide you, but don't expect these fires to be present in the actual research session. Also, be careful with objects in the ground, as they can block your movement.]]></list>

        <title>Tutorial</title>
        <head><![CDATA[Your robot, in addition to the camera, is equipped with a device called a "sensor" that lets you check if objects around you are dangerous or not, in this section, you will learn how to use such a sensor.]]></head>
        <list><![CDATA[The objects you are meant to sense are usually in the ground, to see them you may need to rotate your camera. You can press the key <b>W</b> to rotate the camera upwards, and <b>S</b> to rotate the camera downwards.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[After adjusting the camera, you can use the key <b>Q</b> to activate the sensor and obtain information from the objects around you. Currently, you will obtain such information from all objects in a radius of [sensing_distance_limit] meters from you. The IDs of the sensed objects will appear next to each of them: if the ID text is in red, it means the sensor thinks such an object is dangerous, if it's blue, the sensor thinks it's benign.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[After you click on <b>Next</b>, try adjusting your camera with the <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> keys, and then activate your sensor using the key <b>Q</b>. You are right now in a perfect spot to get information from the three objects next to you, so please don't move. The next popup window will appear after you sense those three objects.]]></list>

        <head><![CDATA[Perfect, you should have now information about three objects.]]></head>
        
        <list><![CDATA[You should see that information reflected in your left sidebar. The next image is an example of what that should look like:]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[Each object has an ID, a weight, and a danger status assigned to it. Unfortunately, the sensor that each robot is equipped with is not perfect. As a result, the estimate the sensor obtains from each object has an associated probability of being correct. Taking as an example the information shown in the previous image, this means that while object 2 is detected as benign with a probability of 73.4%, there is a small chance it might be dangerous instead. You have to share and combine sensing information with other members of your team to correctly identify dangerous objects. One last thing, be aware that activating your sensor on the same object will get you the same reading.]]></list>
        
        <title>Tutorial</title>
        <list><![CDATA[Once you are sure you have located a dangerous object you will have to pick it up and carry it to the goal area. For now, let's just try picking up an object. To do this you will first need to focus on the object of interest by aligning the white dot in the center of your view with the object in question and then press <b>E</b>. You can either move the robot or rotate the camera to make this alignment happen. If you do it correctly, the ID of the object should appear. You can focus on an object even if you haven't sensed it, but you won't know if it's dangerous or not.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[After you focus on the object, you need to get close to it and use either the key <b>A</b> to pick up the object with your left arm, or <b>D</b> to pick it up with your right arm.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[If you are too far away from the object you want to pick up or in a position where it is not possible to pick up such object, a message will appear indicating such an issue. The way to solve this is by just getting closer to the object or approaching the object from a different position.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[After you click on <b>Next</b>, look out for the object partially covered with fire and try aligning the white dot with the object in question, press <b>E</b>, and then press either <b>A</b> or <b>D</b> to pick up the object.]]></list>

        <list><![CDATA[Objects have a weight, and for you to be able to carry an object, your strength needs to match the weight of such object. Each robot has an individual strength, and when you are close enough to other robots, their individual strengths will be added. Both your individual strength and the individual strength of your teammate in the room are 1 unit each in this tutorial. In order to carry heavy objects, just ask other robots to get close to you.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[Robots need to be within [strength_distance_limit] meters from you to add their individual strengths to yours. You can check how far you are from other robots by checking the information displayed in the upper part of the left sidebar.]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[In this panel you will also note that when robots are too far away even for communication, the entry in this table for the particular robot will be red colored.

        <list><![CDATA[The first popup window that appears will show a list with all the objects that are heavier than the achievable maximum strength. You will have to select only those that are dangerous based on your shared sensing estimates. If all of your teammates choose a particular object and that object is benign, you will all be penalized as if you had carried the object to the goal. If all your teammates choose a particular object that is dangerous, you will all be awarded as if you had carried such an object to the goal area. You can also decide not to choose any option. Choose wisely and then submit!]]></list>

        <title>Expectations About AI Agents</title>
        
        <head><![CDATA[AI agents have the following capabilities:]]></head>
        
        <list><![CDATA[They are designed to seek information about objects until they have enough confidence to carry one they think is dangerous, but keep in mind that they might fail in their reasoning]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[They can help you carry objects by following you, just be patient that they may need some time to move. AI agents by default will choose a random location in the goal area and deposit the carried object there]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[They can help you sense specific objects, in that case just follow them and they will tell you their results]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[Whenever you don't want them to follow you, just tell them you don't need their help anymore]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[You can ask them information about any object or agent they know]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[If your team strategy has established leaders, you can order them around, otherwise you have to first request their help and then ask them to follow you, or for you to follow them]]></list>
        <list><![CDATA[They are able to understand your written messages, but they may fail sometimes, so just try again in different ways<br><img src='/media/magnebot.png' style='width:20%;height:auto;margin-top:20px;'/>]]></list>

        <head><![CDATA[AI agents understand your Natural Language messages! Feel free to ask and respond to AI agents however you like through the Chat sidebar. You should always receive an acknowledgement from the AI agents if they understood what you told them, otherwise be patient and try again.
